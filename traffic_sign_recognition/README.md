# This is a Data Sience project of Traffic Sign Recognition for Autonomous Driving

Here I created a model to recognize traffic signs, a fundamental step in developing autonomous vehicle technologies. 
This project focuses on identifying different traffic signs (e.g., stop signs, speed limits) from images
